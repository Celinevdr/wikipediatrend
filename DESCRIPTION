Description: Public attention is an interesting field of study. The
        internet not only allows to access information in no time on
        virtually any subject but via page access statistics gathered
        by website authors the subject of attention as well can be
        studied. For the omnipresent Wikipedia those access statistics
        are made available via stats.grok.se a server providing the
        information as file dumps as well as as web API. This package
        provides an easy to use, consistent and traffic minimizing
        approach to make those data accessible within R.
