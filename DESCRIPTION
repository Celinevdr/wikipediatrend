Description: Public attention besides media attention or some specialized
    expert attention of specific phenomenons is an interesting field of study.
    The internet not only allows to access information in no time on virtually
    any subject but via page access statistics gathered by website authors the
    subject of attention as well as its temporal structure can be studied as
    well. For the omnipresent Wikipedia those access statistics are made
    available via stats.grok.se a server providing the information as file
    dumps as well as web API. The wikipediatrend package provides a easy to
    use, consistent and traffic minimizing approach to make those data
    accessible to the R universe.
