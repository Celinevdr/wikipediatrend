===============================================================================

version 0.3.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- option userAgent deleted: the default is to send information on 
versions of R, wikipediatrend, curl as well as RCurl

- option requestFrom deleted: the default is to not send the header

- wp_trend() now checks date inputs better for logical inconsistencies 
[see: wp_check_date_inputs()]

- wp_trend() now by default caches data retrievals in a temporary file

- wp_trend(file="save.csv") now allows to specify a file where retrievals are 
stored (this will always add to the already existing data)

- wp_trend() now allows to specify more than one page and/or language at a 
time. data than will be retrieved for every combination of page/language/day

- .wp_trend_cache stores the path to the temporary file (last for one session) 
that is used by the package whenever no file is specified by user

- while wp_trend() now (invisibly) returns only data from the current request 
at hand the new function wp_cache() will retrieve data from cache files (by 
default / if no file name is specified it retrieves data from 
.wp_trend_cache) 

- the data returned by wp_trend(), cached in cache-file, retrieved by 
wp_cache() does consist of more variables: date, count, project, title,
rank, month
